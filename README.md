# Product Recognition on Store Shelves

## Project Overview
This project applies computer vision techniques for object detection in a supermarket environment. The goal is to develop a system capable of recognizing products on store shelves using image processing and machine learning techniques. Such a system can be used to assist visually impaired customers or automate common store management tasks (e.g., detecting low stock or misplaced products).

## Features
- Image processing using OpenCV
- Object detection techniques
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Automated analysis of shelf products

## Installation
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`Solution.ipynb`).
2. Provide an image of a store shelf.
3. The system will process the image and identify products using computer vision techniques.
4. Visualize the output using Matplotlib.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Example Output
The project processes store shelf images and marks detected products using bounding boxes. Example visualizations are included in the notebook.
